## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

Graceful degradation is the idea of building a web application with full functionality, and then ensuring it still works — though with reduced features — in older or offline environments. Service workers are a key tool in enabling graceful degradation because they allow web apps to continue functioning even without a network connection. By caching important resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API responses, service workers make sure users still see and use the core app, even if some advanced features (like live updates) degrade gracefully in offline or limited environments.
